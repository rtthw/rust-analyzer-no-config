# `rust-analyzer`, but without global config support

**THIS IS NOT A REAL PROJECT**

Go to [the actual `rust-analyzer` repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/tree/master) for that.

This is just a personal test for another project I'm working on that makes heavy use of `rust-analyzer`'s internals.
